#To install splash lib put it in /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib and run ldconfig, then you don't need the rpath and -L stuff, just -l
#rpath is the run path, it tells ld (the linux dynamic loader) places to look at run time to find libraries, -L is the directories to search for libraries from linking, -l is a library to link to (note that libraries must be called lib(NAME).so.(VERSION_NUMBERS)
